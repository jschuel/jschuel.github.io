          <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            Jeff Schueler is an experimental particle physicist specializing in improving particle detector
            performance through advanced machine learning techniques. Born and raised in the Seattle area,
            he earned his Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Washington,
            where he developed a strong foundation in both theory and data analysis.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduating, Jeff served as a New York City Teaching Fellow at Maspeth High School in Queens,
            NY. As the school’s first physics teacher, he built up the laboratory and curriculum from the
            ground up, introducing AP Physics C in his second year and mentoring students in experimental
            design and scientific reasoning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jeff then moved to Honolulu to pursue graduate studies at the University of Hawaiʻi, where he
            investigated beam-induced neutron backgrounds at the SuperKEKB accelerator for the Belle II
            experiment and led gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC) research and development. In his third year,
            he lived onsite at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, and led the commissioning efforts of shoebox-sized TPCs
            that remain in use to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the final year of his PhD, Jeff spearheaded the application of deep learning to enhance
            particle identification and directional reconstruction in gas TPCs. He developed a custom ResNet
            architecture that demonstrated, for the first time, vector-directional head/tail reconstruction
            of keV-scale nuclear recoils—an important milestone toward competitive directional dark matter
            detectors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jeff received his PhD in 2022 and joined the University of New Mexico as a postdoctoral researcher
            on the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to observe and characterize the Migdal effect in nuclear
            scattering. Early in his tenure, he conceived and implemented a YOLOv8-based real-time image
            analysis pipeline, processing nearly 2 TB of data per hour on a consumer desktop to search for
            Migdal signatures—an approach now running continuously as MIGDAL collects data.
          </p>
          <p>
            His current research interests include data-driven detector simulations, front-end machine
            learning for rare event searches, and interdisciplinary collaborations that leverage AI to
            solve cutting-edge problems in experimental physics.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his spare time, Jeff enjoys crossword puzzles, running, retro video games, cooking, and rock climbing.
          </p>
