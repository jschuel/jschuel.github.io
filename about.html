        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
          Jeff Schueler is an experimental particle physicist specializing in improving particle detector
          performance through advanced machine learning techniques. Born and raised in the Seattle area,
          he earned his Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physics at the University of Washington,
          where he developed a strong foundation in both theory and data analysis.
        </p>

        <p>
          After graduating, Jeff served as a New York City Teaching Fellow at Maspeth High School in Queens,
          NY. As the school’s first physics teacher, he built up the laboratory and curriculum from the ground
          up, introducing AP Physics C in his second year and mentoring students in experimental design
          and scientific reasoning.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jeff then moved to Honolulu to pursue graduate studies at the University of Hawaiʻi, where he
          investigated beam-induced neutron backgrounds at the SuperKEKB accelerator for the Belle II
          experiment and led gas Time Projection Chamber (TPC) research and development. In his third year
          he lived onsite at KEK in Tsukuba, Japan, commissioning shoebox-sized TPC prototypes that remain
          in use today.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the final year of his PhD, Jeff spearheaded the application of deep learning to enhance
          particle identification and directional reconstruction in gas TPCs. He developed a custom ResNet
          architecture that demonstrated, for the first time, vector-directional head/tail reconstruction
          of keV-scale nuclear recoils—an important milestone toward competitive directional dark matter
          detectors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jeff received his PhD in 2022 and joined the University of New Mexico as a postdoctoral researcher
          on the MIGDAL experiment, which aims to observe and characterize the Migdal effect in nuclear
          scattering. Early in his tenure he conceived and implemented a YOLOv8-based real-time image
          analysis pipeline, processing nearly 2 TB of data per hour on a consumer desktop to search for
          Migdal signatures—an approach now running continuously as MIGDAL collects data.
        </p>

        <p>
          His current research interests include data-driven detector simulations, front-end machine
          learning for rare event searches, and interdisciplinary collaborations that leverage AI to
          solve cutting-edge problems in experimental physics.
        </p>
